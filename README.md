# Halloween-Candy-Data-Cleaning-and-Preparation
For this project, the client's goal was to clean and wrangle a data set obtained from a survey of Halloween candy preferences. The objective was to prepare the data for a machine learning project, specifically to predict a person's gender based on their candy preferences. The data set, known as the 2017 Halloween Candy Hierarchy, was sourced from various articles and had undergone slight 
The 2017 Halloween Candy Hierarchy data set was used, and it required cleaning due to its messy nature. Respondents had the option to provide text inputs for certain fields, and some of the comments in the file might be considered inappropriate. However, cleaning such data is a standard practice in data science projects.
As part of this project, I undertook the tasks of data manipulation, cleaning, and wrangling. My contributions included:
1. Performing thorough data cleaning procedures to address missing values, inconsistencies, and inappropriate comments
2. Standardizing the data format and ensuring data integrity
3. Transforming categorical variables into numerical representations suitable for machine learning algorithms
4. Conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights into candy preferences and their potential correlation with gender.
Project Success:
The successful completion of this project involved the following achievements:
1. A cleaned and preprocessed data set ready for further analysis and machine learning modeling.
2. Insights gained from exploratory data analysis provide a better understanding of the relationship between candy preferences and gender.
3. A foundation for future machine learning projects using the prepared data set
Please note that while this project focused on data cleaning and preparation, the actual machine learning modeling and gender prediction were not part of this specific project.
